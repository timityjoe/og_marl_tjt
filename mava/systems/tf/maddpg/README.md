# Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG)

This system is an extension of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to the multi-agent setting, originally proposed by [Lowe et al. (2017)]. The system can be trained in a decentralised, centralised, networked or state-based manner.
